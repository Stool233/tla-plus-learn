CONSTANTS
    KEYS \* The full set of keys in the database
    

VARIABLES
    database, \* database[key] = DataVersion
    cache \* cahce[key] = CacheValue
    
\* Imports cache requirements to test against
INSTANCE cacherequirements


vars == <<database, cache>>

\* A cache can hold a hit or a miss for any given key
CacheValue == CacheMiss \union CacheHit

TypeOk ==
    \* database is a mapping of keys to a data version
    /\ database \in [KEYS -> DataVersion]
    \* cache is a mapping of keys to a cache value 
    /\ cache \in [KEYS -> CacheValue]
    
Init ==
    \* All keys in the database are initialized to their first version
    /\ database = [k \in KEYS |-> 0]
    \* All keys in the cache are initialized to a miss, i.e. no data in cache
    /\ cache = [k \in KEYS |-> [type |-> "miss"]]
    
DatabaseUpdate(k) ==
    \* The version of that key is incremented, representing a write
    /\ database' = [database EXCEPT
                        ![k] = database[k] + 1]
    /\ UNCHANGED cache
    
CacheRead(k) ==
    \* The data is already in the cache
    /\ cache[k] \in CacheHit
    \* So the cache remains the same
    /\ UNCHANGED cache
    /\ UNCHANGED database
    
CacheReadThrough(k) ==
    \* The data is not in the cache
    /\ cache[k] \in CacheMiss
    \* So it is read from the database
    /\ cache' = [cache EXCEPT
                        ![k] = [
                            \* Cache value is now a hit

                            \* Set to whatever version is in database
                            version |-> database[k]
                        ]
                ]
    /\ UNCHANGED database
    
CacheEvict(k) ==
    \* The data is in cache, so can be evicted
    /\ cache[k] \in CacheHit
    \* cache[k] is turned into a miss
    /\ cache' = [cache EXCEPT ![k] = [type |-> "miss"]]
    /\ UNCHANGED database
    

(***************************************************************************)
(* Fairness: Normally no operation is guaranteed to happen; it just may.   *)
(* However, that means that the cache could just stop reading forever.     *)
(* And so it would never update. Now that doesn't seem reasonable.         *)
(***************************************************************************)

\* The cache will always be able to...
CacheFairness ==
    \E k \in KEYS:
        \/ CacheRead(k) \* Read
        \/ CacheReadThrough(k) \* Write
        \* CacheEvict(k) is not here, because CacheEvict is something that
        \*               may happen. It is not guaranteed

\* Cache fairness is included as part of the specification of system behavior.
\* This is just how the system works.
